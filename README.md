# vote-to-play
A twitch extension that allows viewers to vote on what the streamer should play

**User Guide**

The red "V" in the top right corner of the stream will toggle the voting UI.

The UI consists of an image gallery on the left, and the vote results on the right. 
Click on an image to select your vote, and click the "Vote" button to submit your vote. 

You may use the form inputs above the gallery to search for a specific hero, or filter heroes by roles (support, carry, etc.)

You may only vote once, the gallery will disappear upon voting. Once the broadcaster starts a new vote, all users will be eligible to vote again,
and the gallery will reappear.


The vote results will display the top 10 votes (top 3 for Overwatch).
